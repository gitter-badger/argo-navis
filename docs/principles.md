# Argo Navis First Principles

## Principle I: Space-based Sandbox

Argo Navis is a space-based sandbox game, a virtual world where players can choose to engage in any activity.  The primary gameplay is piloting one's starship in the open, continous and persistent world.

Gameplay emerges from the game physics and other generic layers such as manufacturing and deployable modules.

The primary gameplay layers are:

### Exploration

Players can travel through the universe and discover new star systems, planets, moons and other astronomical objects.

Players can navigate to and enter orbit around such objects.

Players can land on planets, moons and other bodies to explorer them further.

Player exploration is how the game world continously grows through procedural generation.

### Mining

Players can extract resources from the world and refine them into raw materials.  Resources are found throughout the world; on and inside planets, moons, asteroids, comets and structures.

Building industrial structures can make retrieving resources easier and more efficient.  Structures may be required to extract some resources but should be optional for most.

### Building

Almost everything players use to interact with the world are built by players.  Raw materials are combined into intermediate materials and final products.

Player-built objects include starships, space stations, their modules and surface structures.

### Combat

Players can engage NPCs (PvE) through exploration and quests.  Players can engage each other (PvP) in less lawful star systems beyond faction space.

Combat is derived from real world military weapons and systems and has a realistic feel to it.  Combat is strongly internally consistent with the game physics and other world aspects.

Combat is inspired by both classical and new games and has a strong "rock-paper-scissors" (but with more dimensions) design to it.

Combat features both classic sci-fi space gameplay and novel mechanisms.  The core of combat is ship defensive mechanisms such as armor, shields and evasive manuvering and weapons such as railguns and lasers.  Game physics have a significant role in combat and ship size, speed and mass are of tactical and strategic importance.

Electronic Warfare (EW), countermeasures (ECM) and counter-countermeasures (ECCM) are inspired by real-world technology and in combination adds complex layers to ship builds, strategy and tactics.

Combat and game design should bring about emergence of a complex "meta game" in PvP where no single strategical or tactical play is optimal in every situation.

### Trade

Players can sell and buy almost any retrievable object.  Fungible objects (e.g. raw materials) can be traded through standard exchange order books and unique items can be traded through auction and escrow mechanisms.

Trade generally takes place inside space stations which provide players with a safe trade environment even in dangerous or lawless star systems.

### Community

Players can form organizations (orgs) such as guilds, corporations and alliances.  These orgs are highly configurable and provide gameplay benefits such as joint ownership of assets such as starships, space stations and industrial structures.

Orgs enable players to configure standings between each other and to conquer space.

### Conquest

Orgs enable players to conquer space, claiming sovereignty of astronomical bodies and entire star systems.  Sovereignty conveys various benefits at the cost of maintaing it through military installations, logistics and defending territory.

### Skills and Role Playing

Player characters can train time-based skills to become better at game activities and unlock more advanced gameplay.

Each skill can be trained a number of levels, each additional level taking longer and longer to train.

Skills form a skill tree, with some advanced skills requiring training in prerequisite skills.
